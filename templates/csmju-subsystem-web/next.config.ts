 * The frontend is the subsystem's only public origin. /api/* and the three
 * SSO endpoints (auth-contract.md 5) go on to the NestJS backend, so the
 * callback registered in Core Hub (http://localhost:<frontend port>/auth/callback),
 * the state cookie of /auth/login and the HttpOnly session cookie all live on
 * the same origin as these pages. Same setup as the reference subsystem
 * (CSMJU2030/demo-student-subsystem, frontend/next.config.ts).
 *
 * next build bakes these rewrites into the build, so BACKEND_URL is read at
 * build time only: from .env in development, and from frontend/Dockerfile
 * (http://api:4000) in the image (deployment.md 3).
